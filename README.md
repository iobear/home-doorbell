# electric-doorbell
Doorbell code for Raspberry Pi

``` Doorbell -> doorbell.wav -> pushover.net ```

Use the binary in the release and make a `config.yaml` from `config-example.yml`
copy the files to your Raspberry Pi.

If you want to compile your self, run `make build` to crosscompile the bin for the pi.
